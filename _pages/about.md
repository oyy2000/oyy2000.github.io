I am Yang Ouyang (欧阳洋 in Chinese), a second-year graduate student in the program Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [School of Pratt](https://pratt.duke.edu/), [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). Previously I received bachelor’s degree at Shenzhen University, where I worked with [Prof. Jianqiang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-oVMPBwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) of [College of CSSE](https://csse.szu.edu.cn/#), Shenzhen University. My research interest includes 
- Large Language Models with Privacy 
- Dataset Augmentation

Currently, I feel very fortunate to collaborate with Ph.D. Students [Jingwei Sun](https://jingwei-sun.com/) and [Jingyang Zhang](https://zjysteven.github.io/) of [CEI Lab](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/) directed by Professor Yiran Chen from ECE Department, Duke University in Pre-trained Data Detection for Large Language Model Privacy Protection and Multi-Modal models training datasets augmentation.
