I'm a second-year graduate student in the program Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [School of Pratt](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). My research interest includes large language models with privacy, computer vision, and machine learning with privacy.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Jingwei Sun](https://jingwei-sun.com/) of CEI Lab from [School of Pratt](https://cei.pratt.duke.edu/), Duke University.
