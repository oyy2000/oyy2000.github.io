permalink: /publication/2024-10-15-Layer-AdvPatcher-1
excerpt: 'Developed the Layer-AdvPatcher framework to defend against jailbreak attacks in LLMs, including a three-step pipeline for defense: i) toxic layer identification, ii) adversarial augmentation, and iii) localized toxic layer editing.
Achieved a 25% reduction in Attack Success Rate using our method across models including Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B compared to modification-based defense methods.'
